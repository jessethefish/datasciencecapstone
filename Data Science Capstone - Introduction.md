## Introduction

<stronh>Over the past number of years, Maine has consistently been rated one of the best states to live in, with Portland topping the lists of "Best Small Cities" in the States. In this project we will be looking to find the best area to live in Maine. We will define 'best' using a number of factors, including:
<ul>
<li> The number of restaurants nearby
<li> The number of venues nearby, in general
<li> Affordability of housing
<li> Median income
<li> Access to good-paying employment
</ul>


## Data

The data we will utilize to investigate and determine what the best neighborhood/area is will be pulled from the Foursquare API, as well as from public demographic datasets. The Foursquare API will give us venue and location-based information, whereas the [http://econ.maine.gov/](Maine State Economists') site will give us access to a variety of demographic datasets.
