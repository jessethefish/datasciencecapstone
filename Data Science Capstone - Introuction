## Introduction

<stronh>In this project we will be looking to find the best area to live in Maine. We will define 'best' using a number of factors, including:
<ul>
<li> The number of restaurants nearby
<li> The number of venues nearby, in general
<li> Affordability of housing
<li> Median income
</ul>


## Data

The data we will utilize to investigate and determine what the best neighborhood/area is will be pulled from the Foursquare API, as well as from public demographic datasets.
